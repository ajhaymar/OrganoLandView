Project Description:
   In response to the need of a local organic horticultural business, to be able to visually inspect collated data, relevant to land use decisions, we are creating a tool that enables relevant and available land data sets to be selected and prioritised so that colour coded overlays, in plan view, plus various other displays, can show a land buyer or owner what they need, to quickly decide whether a particular land parcel is suitable, how valuable and for what crops.
