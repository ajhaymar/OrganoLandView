Project Description:
   In response to the need of a local organic horticultural business, to be able to visually inspect collated data, relevant to land use decisions, we are creating a tool that enables relevant and available land data sets to be selected and prioritised so that colour coded overlays, in plan view, plus various other displays, can show a land buyer or owner what they need, to quickly decide whether a particular land parcel is suitable, how valuable and for what crops.

Challenges:

   INTERNATIONAL:
      Optimise energy and water resource planning

   NEW ZEALAND: 
      Best Creative Use Of Technology
      Best innovative hack using Stats NZ data
      Most Artistic use of data

The 4 of us piled into Paul's Bostock Ute and were taken firstly to their main office: 3 Kirkwood Rd, Flaxmere, where we were shown turtle, doing it's random weed eating, then sheds where recently havested squash were binned and the machinery that did it.  From there, we were shown sites containing a variety of other kinds of tractor towed machines, for such things as tilling, weeding, seed planting and harvesting.  While the technology and expense was impressive the pertinent information was discussed in a Bostock apple orchard in Raupere Rd.  Here, Paul again outlined what he would like from our product and we followed up with questions about the relative value and limitations of data we have found, as recorded in video.

He made it clear that all of the selected data we are aware of is valuable and if it's only point data, verses the area data we have for other things, they will infer what they can but the main thing is that they don't have to read a lot of text to find what they want.  It should link in visually as much as possible.

The reason for asking about the relative value of various data collections is our proposal to enable them as a user, to place weightings on different data sources, that would be used to calculate the opacity of a single map layer, that might then be a proxy for the maximum price per unit area, of various parcels of land they are considering buying.  Having gained an overall score map, they could then select to see a break down of the data sources that cast a shadow of devaluation, at particular locations, in another graphical presentation, perhaps in a vertical slice.
